        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed
        world. The longer you live,
        the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and
        futility. Listen, everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be
        found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of
        wanting to preserve peace, initiates war and hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses causal
        relationships that cannot be separated.

                        section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the
                        Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I
                        occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter
                        what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going
                        to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without
                        any fatigue or stress in the morning.

                        I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who
                        wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like
                        winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society,
                        and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to
                        anyone.
