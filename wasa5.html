                        section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the
                        Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I
                        occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter
                        what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going
                        to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without
                        any fatigue or stress in the morning.

                        I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who
                        wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like
                        winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society,
                        and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to
                        anyone.
